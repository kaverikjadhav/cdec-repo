Once there was a boy And everyone thought, He was a useless guy.
 He always Failed, In every exam Be it First second or third, Or the last, Final term. 
Once he saw an art, Who was trying to climb a wall.
 Fell down, but tried again, And then it did not This lit up his inner soul, He worked harder to achieve his goals. 
And one day he went up so high, That he Finally touched the sky! 
IF you too want achievements, Never, ever cry.
 Just set your goals and aims, And try try and try.
